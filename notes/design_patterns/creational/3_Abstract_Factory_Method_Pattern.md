# Abstract Factory Method Pattern

The Abstract Factory Method Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It involves multiple Factory Methods, one for each type of object to be created.

## Intent and Applicability

- **Intent**: To provide an interface for creating **families** of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Applicability**: Useful in scenarios where a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products, providing a high level of flexibility and scalability.

## Difference Between Abstract Factory and Factory Method

The Abstract Factory and Factory Method patterns are both creational design patterns that deal with object creation, but they serve different purposes and are applied in different scenarios:

- **Factory Method** is about creating a **single object**.
    - It allows a class to defer the instantiation of its objects to its subclasses, providing a way to delegate the creation process to child classes.
    - The Factory Method allows for the extension of the product types and creator types through subclassing the product and  creator interfaces.
- **Abstract Factory** involves creating **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.
    - It provides an interface for creating families of related objects, without needing to know the exact classes of the objects that will be created.
    - The Abstract Factory pattern uses multiple Factory Methods, one for each type of product to be created
    - The concrete implementations of  Abstract Factory implement these methods to create products belonging to same family.


## Components

- **AbstractFactory**: Provides an interface for creating a family of related objects.
- **ConcreteFactory**: Implements the interfaces declared by the AbstractFactory to create concrete products.
- **AbstractProduct**: Declares a type for a family of products.
- **ConcreteProduct**: Implements the AbstractProduct interface to define a product to be created by the corresponding ConcreteFactory.
- **Client**: Uses interfaces declared by the AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Promotes consistency among products.
- Isolates concrete classes from the client.
- Supports interchangeability and scalability of families of products.

### Disadvantages
- Can be more complex to set up due to the multiple layers of abstraction.

## Real-world Applications

- **UI Toolkits and Themes**: Differentiating between families of products such as UI elements that vary between operating systems.
- **Cross-platform Software Development**: Creating suites of products where each family corresponds to a different operating system.
- **Database Access Libraries**: Libraries providing a uniform interface to access different types of databases, abstracting the specific database access APIs.

## Design Considerations

Implementing the Abstract Factory Pattern requires careful consideration to maintain flexibility and ensure that adding new families of products does not require extensive changes to the existing factory interface.
