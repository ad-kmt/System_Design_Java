# Introduction to Design Patterns

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design.

## Why Learn Design Patterns?

- **Problem-Solving Toolkit**: Design patterns offer a toolkit of tried and tested solutions for frequent challenges in software design.
- **Communication**: With a standard terminology specific to certain scenarios, design patterns make it easier to discuss software designs with other developers.
- **Better Design Decisions**: Being familiar with various design patterns enables us to make informed design decisions, leading to software that's more robust, flexible, and easier to maintain.
- **Understanding Frameworks**: Many frameworks and libraries implement design patterns; understanding them helps us better utilize these frameworks.

## Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns can be grouped into three categories based on their purpose:

### Creational Patterns
These patterns focus on mechanisms of object creation, making the process more suitable to the situation. Examples include:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns
These patterns describe how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping the structures flexible and efficient. Examples include:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns deal with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Examples include:
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## Conclusion

Understanding design patterns is key to creating flexible, reusable, and maintainable software. This introduction marks just the beginning of our journey into the world of design patterns. As we explore each pattern in more detail, we'll gain a deeper understanding of how to apply these solutions to real-world software design challenges.
